# Pitch #1

## Kali-Ma

**In this project there are 6 people: José, Sérgio, Vasco (Red Team), Hugo, Guilherme and Diogo (Blue Team)**

### Summary

Kali-ma aims to enumerate the target network, gleaning as much information as possible about the various hosts and their configurations. Document in detail what tools were used and how much you were able to reveal. Create a professional network topology of the target environment for inclusion in your final report.
Discover vulnerabilities on targets hosts on the network. There will be at least one web application for you to discover and test against, in addition to several other instances running various operating systems with unknown configurations.
Exploit and gain access to as many host instances as possible, and as deeply as possible.
Build/customize and utilize at least one custom Python tool to aid in your team's offensive efforts.

### What problem or pain point does it solve?

With these objectives we aim to solve the main problem of protecting the system from potential cyberattacks. It does this by identifying and fixing any weak points or vulnerabilities in the system before actual malicious hackers can exploit them.

### Minimum viable product (MVP) :

* A project report documenting the assessment process and findings. This would include:
* Network enumeration and topology mapping
* Vulnerabilities discovered on hosts
*	Hosts exploited and level of access obtained
*	Screenshots and details of exploits/access to back up findings
*	Description of any custom tools or automation developed
*	Documentation of individual contributions to the project

The MVP would cover the key requirements of enumerating the network, discovering vulnerabilities, exploiting systems, and documenting the process and results. It would not require all objectives to be fully completed. The minimum is providing a clear report of the assessment along with evidence to support the findings. This allows presenting initial results while leaving room to discuss lessons learned and next steps.
The goal is to demonstrate understanding of the assessment process and next steps for security improvements, even with partial completion of the objectives.
